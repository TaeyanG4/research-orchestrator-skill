# CV Leakage Study — Handoff

This file records **what happened and where to resume**. What is known — claims, numbers, interpretations, verification — lives in `discoveries.md`; this file points to it by ID instead of repeating it.

## Shared state

- Active agent(s): A, B, C
- Current project state: validation fixed to deduplicated GroupKFold; feature work in progress
- Current best: baseline LightGBM, GroupKFold CV 0.9030 (D-A-001)
- Active compute: local CPU (A, B); local GPU idle
- Open consistency issues: none

Project-wide values live only here, never in `plan.md`. `Current best` always cites the discovery that set it, for example `fold-aware TE, GroupKFold CV 0.9112 (D-A-005)`; when a discovery's `Implication` starts with `new current best:`, update it in the same step. List problems you found in another agent's sections under `Open consistency issues`; the owner or the user resolves them and removes the line.

Agent names are work slots (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...), never host or model names. A new concurrent session takes the next unused name and adds it to `Active agent(s)` together with its plan and handoff sections.

## Active handoff — Agent sections

Each research agent reads and edits only its own active handoff section. Do not copy another agent's unfinished plan here.

- `Current host` records which host (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, ...) currently owns the slot. A slot is free when it reads `unassigned` or `released`; a free slot that still holds plan items left by a different host is skipped unless the user assigns it. Set it to your host when you take or resume the slot, and to `released` when you close the session. Other sessions may read only the `Current host` and `Current thread` lines of your section: to find a free slot, or to take over a queued item other than your `Current thread` when their own queue runs out (same host only).
- `Resumable state` is half-done work that exists nowhere else: a drafted script, a running job, a partial output.
- `Next action` names plan item IDs (`H-B-03, then H-B-02`) or a step that is not a plan item; it does not restate the item's `Next test`. Every ID named here must exist in `plan.md`.

### Agent: A
- Current host: Claude Code
- Current thread: H-A-04
- Resumable state: experiments/e004_fold_te.py drafted, not run yet
- Blocker: none
- Next action: H-A-04

### Agent: B
- Current host: Codex
- Current thread: H-B-03 (cross-check of D-A-001)
- Resumable state: experiments/e002_dedup.py running with fold seed 11
- Blocker: none
- Next action: finish H-B-03 by recording a verdict on D-A-001, then H-B-02

### Agent: C
- Current host: released
- Current thread: none
- Resumable state: none; H-C-02 was taken over by A as H-A-04
- Blocker: none
- Next action: none; free slot


## Completed / review log

All agents may read this shared log. Append completed work, take-overs, meaningful resource-routing changes, and discovery-review events here. Entries are append-only.

Use this exact format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — A — H-A-01
- Host: Claude Code | Codex | Antigravity | <other>
- Action: ...
- Result: <one line>; see <discovery ID>
- Artifacts: <paths> / none
- Discovery updates: D-A-001 / none — <reason>
- Review verdict: <discovery ID> CLOSED | HOLD | CHALLENGED / none
- Resource: CPU | GPU | Other | none
- Other executor: Kaggle / none
- New plan items: H-A-02, H-A-03 / none — <reason>
```

- The heading's last part is the plan item the event completed; write `none` for a step that completes nothing (a routing change, a session close) and the new ID for a take-over. Items you drop as pointless are named in `Action` as `removed H-A-05 — <reason>`.
- `Result` is one line; for an experiment it points to the discovery instead of restating its numbers.
- `Artifacts` lists paths only. Metrics and their meaning belong in the discovery.
- Every completed experiment creates or updates a discovery, so `Discovery updates: none — <reason>` is only for steps that are not experiments, such as a take-over (`Action: took over H-C-03 from C (same host) as H-A-05`).
- `New plan items` is never a bare `none`; zero follow-ups always gives a reason.
- There is no next-step line here; the slot's `Next action` above is the only one.

### 2026-10-05 14:20 — B — H-B-01
- Host: Codex
- Action: compared random KFold with GroupKFold on customer_id groups
- Result: random CV is optimistic; see D-B-001
- Artifacts: experiments/e001_group_check.py; outputs/e001.csv
- Discovery updates: D-B-001
- Review verdict: none
- Resource: CPU
- Other executor: none

### 2026-10-05 15:05 — A — H-A-01
- Host: Claude Code
- Action: cross-checked D-B-001 with fold seed 7
- Result: reproduced; see the review on D-B-001
- Artifacts: outputs/e001_seed7.csv
- Discovery updates: D-B-001 (review)
- Review verdict: D-B-001 CLOSED

### 2026-10-05 16:40 — A — H-A-02
- Host: Claude Code
- Action: removed exact duplicate rows and rebuilt GroupKFold folds
- Result: duplicates explain most of the gap and set a new current best; see D-A-001
- Artifacts: experiments/e002_dedup.py; outputs/e002.csv
- Discovery updates: D-A-001
- Review verdict: none
- Resource: CPU
- Other executor: none

### 2026-10-05 17:30 — C — H-C-01
- Host: Claude Code
- Action: audited categorical encoders for leakage under GroupKFold
- Result: encoders are fit before the fold split; see D-C-001
- Artifacts: notes/encoding_audit.md
- Discovery updates: D-C-001
- Review verdict: none

- Host: Claude Code
- Action: tested global target encoding on deduplicated data
- Result: hypothesis failed; see D-A-002

### 2026-10-05 18:20 — A — H-A-04
- Host: Claude Code
- Action: took over H-C-02 from C (same host) as H-A-04
